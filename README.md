# 2PI502
A low-cost version of Ben Eater's 6502 Breadboard Computer using a real R6502 CPU but emulating RAM/ROM/VIA/UART using Raspberry Pi Pico 2 MCUs and emulating connected devices on a WEB USB page or perhaps some sort of device driver interface including a PTY so that you can connect a terminal emulator or xterm or something to the UART
